# Rest Metrics Exploratory Data Analysis

This exploratory analysis portfolio project investigates sleep behavior trends using over six years of data collected from multiple sources. I used SQL for data processing, Excel to merge accounts, and Tableau to build a dashboard for insights. I found sleep and wake times shifted dramatically and less naps were taken during the Covid-19 pandemic, revealing the impact of global events on personal health metrics.

Project Objectives

- [x] extract, clean and prepare data
- [x] merge and validate data from multiple sources
- [x] perform exploratory data analysis of dataset
