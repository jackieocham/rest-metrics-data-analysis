# Rest Metrics Exploratory Data Analysis

## Portfolio Project No. 1

This exploratory analysis project investigates sleep behavior trends using over six years of data collected from multiple sources. I used SQL to clean and prepare the dataset, Excel to merge accounts, and Tableau to build a dashboard for insights. I found sleep and wake times shifted dramatically during the Covid-19 pandemic, revealing the impact of global events on personal health metrics.

Tools: MySQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau, GitHub, VS Code
